## About Me

- Software Developer
- Full stack JavaScript Developer striving for excellence within the industry.

## Personal Pitch

- I'm currently studying Software Development at Code Fellows, where I will obtain a certificate in Advanced Software Development in JavaScript. I am taking a really big step within my professional career by embracing the discomfort of changing careers. One of my greatest strengths is that I refuse to give up on something even if I don't understand it in that moment. My supervisors from my past job have commended me for my hard work, and patience. As a motivated, organized, and logical thinking individual, I aspire to further my knowledge within the tech industry, and build strong relationships with the people I network with.

## What excites you the most about tech?

- I'm really looking forward to being able to help create something that people will use in their day to day lives. I find it exciting to see the reactions (good or bad) from those who have used or witnessed a project I have worked on.
